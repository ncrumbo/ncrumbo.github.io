      <p>My name is Nakia. I am from Joplin, Mo., before attending OTC I was working for the YMCA in maintenance and customer service; during my time there I enjoyed coaching little leagues and setting up community events. I have been attending OTC since spring 2019, this is my 5th semester. My major is Networking Technology some of my accomplishments while attending OTC is being a member and officer of the OTC Honors Program.
