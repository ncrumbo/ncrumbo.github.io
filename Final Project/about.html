        <p class="flex-grow-1"> I am Nakia Crumbo, I am currently a student attending Ozarks Technical Community College pursuing a dual major in network technology and computer science. I am from Joplin Missouri, I have been a residence there for 12 years living out in the country.</p>
        <p class="flex-grow-1">Fascinated with technology since childhood. I started my journey to turn my passion and hobbies into a career by enrolling into Ozarks Technical Community College in the spring of 2019. I have always been enthused with computers and electronics it has always been a part of what I love to do. I remember going to K-mart when I was a child loved going to the electronics section to play the video games that were always on display.</p>
        <p class="flex-grow-1">My first PC was a Commodore plus 4 it was a old 64kb system that had a tape and floppy disk drive that I recieced for Christmas when I was 15 years of age. This was when I started to learn about programming.</p>
        <p class="flex-grow-1">It wasn't until graduation in the year of 1993 that I was able to find employment and purchase my own system from then I learned how to build my first web site from Geocities, since then web design has always been a hobby where I have created some free lance webdesign for friends and family. Now, the time has finally passed to turn this hobby into a profession that I enjoy doing.</p>
        <p class="flex-grow-1">My aspiration is to graduate from Ozarks Technical Community College with a dual major in network technology and computer science then further my education to a Masters degree in Cybersecurity.</p>
        <p class="flex-grow-1">Some of the classes that I have taken in the past have been Managing Personal Computer Systems, Network Communication and Cabling, Windows Client Server, Linux Operation Systems, CCNA Intro Networking, CCNA Routing and Switching, Information Security, Intro to Computer Programming and now Web Design! Some of the classes that I want to take in the future are PHP, Javascript, C# and C++. Classes that I will be taking next semester are Virtualization, Intro to Electric safety and theory, CCNA Enterprise networking, security and automation.</p>
        <p class="flex-grow-1">Some of the achievements that I have earned along the way have been awarded the chancellor and dean honor rolls and currently a honor student and officer of the student council.</p>
